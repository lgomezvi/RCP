# implementation strategy

1. emergency stop button 
2. safety strategies, stability & motor angle 
3. configuring the reorient() function for starting position of the robot.
4. test serial input from the client to the Pi to the arduino - use LED
5. define and test input and output returns 
6. individual motor executions -- integrate motor by motor with the server

NOTE: The current motor movement is discrete/single-sequential, where no 2 motors are moving at the same time.
